## Gitar: Automate Code Maintenance, Accelerate Innovation.

Stop drowning in technical debt and tedious maintenance. Gitar leverages cutting-edge AI to automate the entire code maintenance lifecycle, freeing your developers to build what matters most. 

#### WHY

Modern software development demands constant evolution â€“ framework migrations, library upgrades, security patches, and cleaning up technical debt are relentless tasks. This essential maintenance consumes valuable engineering time, slows down feature delivery, and can introduce risks across increasingly complex and diverse codebases. Manual efforts and traditional tools often fall short, struggling with scale, precision, and the polyglot nature of today's applications. 

#### HOW

Gitar tackles code maintenance with an **AI-native approach**. Our core **Amp engine** combines deep, compiler-level code analysis with powerful AI to understand your code's structure and semantics, enabling precise, automated transformations. Guiding this process is **Jimy, our agentic AI**, designed to autonomously plan and execute maintenance tasks across your entire software lifecycle â€“ from IDE to CI and production. Jimy analyzes your specific codebase to generate custom plans, handling complexity across all major programming languages and frameworks. 

#### WHAT

 * **Intelligent End-to-End Automation:** Let Jimy, our AI agent, plan and execute library/framework migrations, security fixes, and more, generating automated Pull Requests. 
 * **Comprehensive Code Maintenance:** Go beyond basic migrations. Automate deep cleanups like dead code removal and feature flag cleanup to keep your codebase healthy and efficient. 
 * **Polyglot Power:** Seamlessly manage maintenance across diverse technology stacks with support for all major languages and frameworks. 
 * **Precision & Scale:** Rely on our AI-native Amp engine for accurate, compiler-level changes that scale to large, complex codebases. 
 * **Enterprise Ready:** Deploy securely in the cloud or on-premise, backed by SOC 2 Type 2 compliance. 

By automating the toil of code maintenance, Gitar empowers your team to pay down technical debt effortlessly and focus on delivering innovative features faster.
