We're a passionate group of developers committed to crafting exceptional developer tools. Having felt the pain of using tools that excel in isolation but crumble when integrated. We're on a mission to redefine the developer experience through opinionated and tightly integrated tools.

Our journey involves developing advanced tools seamlessly woven into the developer lifecycle – from design to production. With a track record of enhancing developer sentiment. We take pride in our contributions to open-source projects like:

* 🔥[Piranha](https://github.com/uber/piranha): Automating the cleanup of stale feature flags
* 🔍[Nullaway](https://github.com/uber/NullAway): Eliminating NullPointerExceptions (NPEs) in Java 
* 🔧[Nilaway](https://github.com/uber-go/nilaway): Avoiding nil panics in Go
* ♻️[OkBuck](https://github.com/uber/okbuck): Facilitating seamless build system migrations
* 🚀[Go-PGO](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/55022-pgo-implementation.md): Profile Guided Optimizations for Go

Join us on this exciting journey, where we aim to [pave golden paths](https://tanzu.vmware.com/golden-paths) for a seamless developer experience. 🌟 #DeveloperTools #RevolutionizingDevEx
