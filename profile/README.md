# Supercharge CI with AI

[Gitar](https://gitar.ai) is the intelligence layer that turns CI into an agent platform. It automatically fixes broken builds and failing tests, and addresses code review feedback, saving you hours every day and keeping your development flow uninterrupted.

## Getting started

1. **Install GitHub App**: Add Gitar to your repositories. No account or credit card required.
2. **Start Using**: Gitar automatically monitors your PRs and suggests or commits fixes for failing builds and tests. You can also trigger Gitar with comments starting with `Gitar` to fix bugs, improve test coverage, update documentation, and automatically perform other tasks during code review.
3. **Stay Focused**: Gitar provides real-time updates directly in your GitHub PR allowing you see progress directly in your code review interface.

*[Enterprise features](https://go.gitar.ai/enterprise) available for organizations requiring advanced controls and integrations.*

## How it works

- Get automatic fixes for failing builds and tests on your PRs/MRs
- Automatically address review feedback like: fix bugs, improve test coverage and update documentation etc.
- Gain back focus time by letting Gitar handle tasks in the background
- Stay updated on progress without leaving your code review UI

Stop wasting time on broken builds. Let Gitar handle CI failures and code review comments automatically.
