We're a passionate group of developers committed to crafting exceptional developer tools. Having felt the pains of using tools that excel in isolation but crumble when integrated, we're on a mission to redefine the developer experience through opinionated and tightly integrated tools.

Our journey involves developing advanced tools seamlessly woven into the developer lifecycle – from design to production. With a track record of enhancing developer sentiment, we take pride in our contributions to open-source projects like:

* 🔥[Piranha]([url](https://github.com/uber/piranha)): Automating the cleanup of stale feature flags
* 🔍[Nullaway]([url](https://github.com/uber/NullAway)): Eliminating NullPointerExceptions (NPEs) in Java 
* 🔧[Nilaway]([url](https://github.com/uber-go/nilaway)): Avoiding nil panics in Go
* ♻️[OkBuck]([url](https://github.com/uber/okbuck)): Facilitating seamless build system migrations
* 🚀[Go-PGO]([url](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/55022-pgo-implementation.md)): Profile Guided Optimizations for Go

Join us on this exciting journey, where we aim to pave golden paths for a seamless developer experience. 🌟 #DeveloperTools #RevolutionizingDevEx
